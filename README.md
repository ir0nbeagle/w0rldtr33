What is this?

This Python script is designed to analyze Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses, URLs, and file hashes, by querying two threat intelligence services: VirusTotal and GreyNoise. It allows users to input IOCs either manually or from a file, then performs a detailed analysis using these external services to provide insights into the reputation and activity of the IOCs.

How could this help?

This tool is useful for security analysts, incident responders, and threat hunters who need to quickly assess whether IOCs are benign or malicious. It automates the process of cross-referencing IOCs with threat intelligence databases, speeding up the detection of potential threats. Additionally, the ability to log results provides historical tracking of IOCs, enabling teams to monitor changes in behavior or risk over time. By streamlining IOC analysis, this script enhances the efficiency of threat detection and incident response.
